# Get-Preservation-Ready
The Get Preservation Ready tool was created to help researchers access basic advice and tips to help maintain their digital files for the long-term. 

## Features
This tool was built using Twine, an open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories. 

It features:
-	Interactive story structure
-	Identification of preservation goals and priorities
-	Example scenarios to put preservation choices and actions into context
-	3 simple tips for each pathway, with downloadable checklists to help achieve these
-	Handy glossary for archival or digital preservation terminology
-	Mobile friendly
-	Accessible typeface and colour scheme

## How do I use it?
### If you are a researcher:
To open the tool, simply paste the following link into your preferred browser: https://ailieohagan.github.io/Get-Preservation-Ready/ 
The Get-Preservation-Ready.html file may also be downloaded and opened offline. It will display in any HTML reader with javascript enabled. 
Navigate through the tool by clicking on the written prompts. Words and phrases highlighted in bold are interactive, and linked to a handy glossary.  
The 'Get Preservation Ready' tool is suitable for use on PC, laptop, tablet, or mobile device.

### To use it as a digital preservation advocacy tool:
This tool is designed to be edited where needed, so the guidance can be tailored to reflect your institutional policies and preferences, or example scenarios updated for relevance to your users. To edit any section, it is recommended you first install the open-source software, Twine, which is available at twinery.org. 

1. Either using Twine for Desktop or Browser: tap the 'Library' tab and select 'Import'. Then, Import Stories -> Choose file (select the file: Get-Preservation-Ready.html)

3. The cards, called 'Passages', are clustered into 6 categories: Recipe , Collection , Model , Practical Tool , Experience , and Story. Double click to open the relevant passage you wish to edit. This will open a dialogue box at the side of the screen. Any text within single square brackets [ ] can be edited as desired, to update the advice for your users.

4. To link a new word to the Glossary, type ->Glossary after the word, and wrap around a double square bracket [[   ]] . For example, writing [[preservation->Glossary]] will result in a clickable word 'preservation' that will take the user to the Glossary.
 
5. Once you are happy with your changes, you will find the option to 'Publish to File' under the Build tab.

This tool may also be used 'as is', either by embedding the code directly from GitHub, or downloading the Get-Preservation-Ready.html file. It will display in any HTML reader with javascript enabled.
